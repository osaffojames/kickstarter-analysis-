# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Alalysis of launch dates and goal outcomes of Kickstarter dataset 

### Purpose
Give an Analysis of launch dates and goal outcomes of Kickstarter dataset. The purpose of that analysis is to show Louise how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dateds and their fund raiser goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 

To get to this result I had extract the months within the pivot chart and then filtered it.   


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 
Based on this chart I can show that there was zero cancelations across the board. I can also show that the smaller range outcomes were met, nut as we got to the higher goals the the outcoem decreased. and it was the opposite fot the fails.

To get this results I had to cumpute formulas usking the =COUNTOIF, =ROUND,and =IFERROR statements.      


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges and difficulties that I encountered were getting my formulas right, placing values in the pivot table firlds to get the right outcomes, and making sure my X-axis and Y-axis were displaying the correct data points.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

After developing the pivot table and then develipong the line chart I can see that there as somewhat a lag in launch dated from Jan to Mar, but then there was a spike in starting in Apr to May. Then a dip starting the following months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on this chart I can show that there was zero cancelations across the board. I can also show that the smaller range outcomes were met, nut as we got to the higher goals the the outcoem decreased. and it was the opposite fot the fails.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Based on the information provided i do not believe there was any limitations to the data set. It provided everything needed to run statistical measures. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

I do not believe we could have used any other charts.
